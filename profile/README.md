# Negev Urban Research (NUR)

## Overview
NUR is a collaboration between the MIT Media Lab and Ben Gurion University that aims to study urban innovation on the edge of the desert in the Negev. Our goal is to deploy scalable solutions for arid human settlement in the region and beyond.

## Our Approach
Utilizing new design methodologies requires a multidisciplinary approach. NUR creates collaborative platforms where scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and designers can partner with city governments and local communities to develop novel design tools and processes for creating equitable and sustainable cities.
