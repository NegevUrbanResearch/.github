# Negev Urban Research 

NUR is collaboration between the MIT Media Lab and Ben Gurion University that aims to study urban unnovation on the edge of the desert in the Negev and deploy scalable solutions for arid human settlement in the region and beyond.

Utilizing new design methodologies requires a multidisciplinary approach – NUR creates collaborative platforms where scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and designers can partner with city governments and local communities and develop novel design tools and processes for creating equitable and sustainable cities.

Located in Be'er Sheva and serving cities throughout Israel, the NUR lab is a creative workspace for visiting researchers and project-specific teams to meet and tackle specific questions and opportunities together. NUR Lab fosters the exchange of innovative methods and creative approaches through conferences, workshops and public discussions.

NUR was launched in 2024 as a collaboration between the MIT Media Lab, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, and SCE Negev School of Architecture. It is part of MIT’s global City Science Network – a learning network of 10 collaborative international labs, each solving local challenges that have global implications.

Nur is funded, in part, by the State of Israel’s joint ministry task force.
